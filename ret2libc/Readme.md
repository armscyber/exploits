# Ret2Libc
This is a rop attack in which exploit.py does reverse engineering on a binary called pwn, and finds the necessary gadgets to call the system and /bin/sh syscalls in libc to spawn a shell.

The expected behavior of the program is that it asks for your name, you provide your name, it prints out hello there {your name} and ends.

The actual behavior when you insert the payload is the program asks for your name, you provide the payload, a shell is started, and you can do whatever you want on the system like delete files.

## How to run

```
python3 exploit.py
```
